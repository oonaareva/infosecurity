 ## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 
 
  ### 10.1, Choosing an algorithm
  When choosing an algorithm, one can trust one of these to be reliable:
  - a published algorithm that has not yet been broken
  - a well-known manufacturer
  - a private consultant
  - the government
  - write own algorithm

All of these have their problems, but the first one is the most sensible. It's difficult to choose the most secure algorithms, because the most secure ones are probably developed by the military, but we don't know what algorithms various military cryptanalysts are capable of breaking. A good assumption is that the NSA (National Security Agency of USA) can read any message that it chooses, but not all messages that it chooses, because they are also burdened by limited resources. They also prefer to keep their code-breaking skills a secret. The NSA approves all cryptographic products for export, and there is a conspiracy that they know how to break all export algorithms.
  
  ### 10.2, Public-key cryptography versus symmetric cryptography
  These two types of cryptography have been debated agaisnt each other since the invention of public-key cryptography, but they can't be compared on an equal footing. 
   
  Symmetric cryptography is best for encrypting data. Public-key cryptography is best for key management and a lot of protocols.
  
  ### 10.3, Encyrpting communications channels
  - OSI Open Systems Interconnect communications models
    
  **link-by-link encryption**: encryption that takes place at the lowest layers of the OSI model. Everything going through a particular data link is encrypted.
  - Hardware encryption devices at the physical layer is the easiest way to add encryption. It's also very effective, because everything is encrypted, such as data, routing and protocol information.
  - traffic-flow security: enemy doesn't have access to the information nor where and how much information is flowing.
  - The problem with physical layer encryption is that any unencrypted link will jeopardize the entire network's security. 
  - Also, every node (a what?) must be protected. If the network misroutes information, anyone can read it. 
    
  **end-to-end encryption**: encryption that takes place on the higher layers of the OSI model. Data stays encrypted until decryption by final recipient.
  - The problem with this method is that the routing information is not encrypted, so cryptanalyst can know who is talking to who and when. This is called traffic analysis.
  - building e2e encryption equipment is difficult, because each communication system has their own protocols. 
  - encryption at high layers interacts with user software, so it has to be optimized for different computer systems. 
    
  Combining these two methods is expensive, but the most effective way to secure a network. Key management for the two can be completely separate.
    
  ### 10.4, Encrypting data for storage
    
  While resending a mmessage works, re-encrypting a message isn't possible. So there should be mechanisms to prevent unrecoverable errors in ciphertext. (what is that??)
  Key management procedures should assume that same keys can be used many times, and that data might stay encrypted for long times. Key should exist for the duration of it's use; for storages might be years and should be securily stored.
  - Problems:
  - data might also exist in plain-text.
  - Key management for different people.
  - long term storage of keys.
  Also, the unencrypted file has to be erased after encryption.
    
  **Dereferencing keys**
  With large hard drives, there's 2 choices:
  - Encrypt all of it with one key; reading just a part is not possible.
  - Encrypt in parts; users have to memorize each parts key.
  Or, encrypt in parts and then encrypt a file with the keys. Then users only have to memorize the key holding all other keys.
  
  **Driver level vs. file-level encryption**
  - File-level means each file is encrypted separately. 
  - driver level a logical drive is maintained on user's machine where all data is encrypted. Usually the driver prompts the user for a password before starting up, which is used to generate the master decryption key.
    
  **Providing random access to an encrypted drive**
  There are disc sectors on the drive. Most systems expect to access these randomly, which complicates using stream ciphers and block ciphers in chaining mode.
    
  Stream cipher: A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream). In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream.
    
  Block cipher: A block cipher is a method of encrypting data in blocks to produce ciphertext using a cryptographic key and algorithm. The block cipher processes fixed-size blocks simultaneously, as opposed to a stream cipher, which encrypts data one bit at a time.
    
  Sector addresses can be used to generate unique IVs for each sector being encrypted/decrypted.
    
  IV: Initialization Vector. We use an IV in a cryptographic algorithm as a starting state, adding this to a cipher to hide patterns in the encrypted data. This helps avoid the need to re-issue a new key after each invocation.
    
  For the master key, generate a pseudo-random block as large as one sector.
    
  You can use a block cipher with a large enough block size that it can encrypt the whole sector at once.
   
 ## Choose a password manager
 I chose Norton Password Manager, available here: [Norton PM](https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager).
   
 It is free and voted by Forbes as the overall best free password manager. Therefore it is accessible to many. It works on most platforms: Android, iOS, Mac and Windows.
 
 It operates locally in a browser extension. 
  
 ### What treaths does it protect against?
 It protects against head-on hacker attacks. The company also has a zero-knowledge policy, meaning only you have access to your vault.
 
 ### What information is encrypted, what's not?
 Norton utilizes 256-bit AES encryption on end-to-end level. It means everthing inputted into the user's secure storage vault is encrypted. 
 
 ### What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
 I don't understand this question. Googling "Norton license" or "password manager license" gives me hits for end user license agreements or Finnish legal documents which I doubt are meant by this question. 
 Unless that is what is meant, Norton is free to use and download, and works best for individuals, self-employed or small businesses.
 
 If anyone reviewing my report knows, please let me know and I will read up on it!!
 
 ### Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
 The data is stored in the cloud. According to NortonLifeLock support, "All data, including cloud storage, is held in the United States and the European Union".
 
 If there are any inquiries regarding the management of user's data, they provide regional privacy departments that can be found [here](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v127350378).
 
 ### How is the data protected?
 The data is protected by a robust encryption. Here is how the 256-bit AES encryption works:
   
 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a computer security standard for cryptographically securing electronic information. It is the only publicly available block cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for transmission and encryption of secret and top-secret information and intelligence.
 
It would take a supercomputer billions of years to crack even a 128-bit AES key. The 256-bit is the largest AES key length size and also the most difficult to crack.

AES 256-bit encryption uses 14 transformation rounds to convert plaintext into ciphertext. It is the most secure technically and some even call it overkill.
