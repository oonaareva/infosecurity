 # Homework assignment 5
 
 ## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 
 
  ### 10.1, Choosing an algorithm
  When choosing an algorithm, one can trust one of these to be reliable:
  - a published algorithm that has not yet been broken
  - a well-known manufacturer
  - a private consultant
  - the government
  - write own algorithm

All of these have their problems, but the first one is the most sensible. It's difficult to choose the most secure algorithms, because the most secure ones are probably developed by the military, but we don't know what algorithms various military cryptanalysts are capable of breaking. A good assumption is that the NSA (National Security Agency of USA) can read any message that it chooses, but not all messages that it chooses, because they are also burdened by limited resources. They also prefer to keep their code-breaking skills a secret. The NSA approves all cryptographic products for export, and there is a conspiracy that they know how to break all export algorithms.
  
  ### 10.2, Public-key cryptography versus symmetric cryptography
  These two types of cryptography have been debated agaisnt each other since the invention of public-key cryptography, but they can't be compared on an equal footing. 
   
  Symmetric cryptography is best for encrypting data. Public-key cryptography is best for key management and a lot of protocols.
  
  ### 10.3, Encrypting communications channels
  - OSI Open Systems Interconnect communications models
    
  **Link-By-Link encryption**: encryption that takes place at the lowest layers of the OSI model. Everything going through a particular data link is encrypted.
  - Hardware encryption devices at the physical layer is the easiest way to add encryption. It's also very effective, because everything is encrypted, such as data, routing and protocol information.
  - traffic-flow security: enemy doesn't have access to the information nor where and how much information is flowing.
  - The problem with physical layer encryption is that any unencrypted link will jeopardize the entire network's security. 
  - Also, every node (a what?) must be protected. If the network misroutes information, anyone can read it. 
    
  **End-To-End encryption**: encryption that takes place on the higher layers of the OSI model. Data stays encrypted until decryption by final recipient.
  - The problem with this method is that the routing information is not encrypted, so cryptanalyst can know who is talking to who and when. This is called traffic analysis.
  - building e2e encryption equipment is difficult, because each communication system has their own protocols. 
  - encryption at high layers interacts with user software, so it has to be optimized for different computer systems. 
    
  Combining these two methods is expensive, but the most effective way to secure a network. Key management for the two can be completely separate.
    
  ### 10.4, Encrypting data for storage
    
  While resending a message works, re-encrypting a message isn't possible. So there should be mechanisms to prevent unrecoverable errors in ciphertext. (what is that??)
  Key management procedures should assume that same keys can be used many times, and that data might stay encrypted for long times. Key should exist for the duration of it's use; for storages might be years and should be securily stored.
  - Problems:
  - data might also exist in plain-text.
  - Key management for different people.
  - long term storage of keys.
  Also, the unencrypted file has to be erased after encryption.
    
  **Dereferencing keys**
  With large hard drives, there's 2 choices:
  - Encrypt all of it with one key; reading just a part is not possible.
  - Encrypt in parts; users have to memorize each parts key.
  Or, encrypt in parts and then encrypt a file with the keys. Then users only have to memorize the key holding all other keys.
  
  **Driver level vs. file-level encryption**
  - File-level means each file is encrypted separately. 
  - driver level a logical drive is maintained on user's machine where all data is encrypted. Usually the driver prompts the user for a password before starting up, which is used to generate the master decryption key.
    
  **Providing random access to an encrypted drive**
  There are disc sectors on the drive. Most systems expect to access these randomly, which complicates using stream ciphers and block ciphers in chaining mode.
    
  Stream cipher: A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream). In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream.
    
  Block cipher: A block cipher is a method of encrypting data in blocks to produce ciphertext using a cryptographic key and algorithm. The block cipher processes fixed-size blocks simultaneously, as opposed to a stream cipher, which encrypts data one bit at a time.
    
  Sector addresses can be used to generate unique IVs for each sector being encrypted/decrypted.
    
  IV: Initialization Vector. We use an IV in a cryptographic algorithm as a starting state, adding this to a cipher to hide patterns in the encrypted data. This helps avoid the need to re-issue a new key after each invocation.
    
  For the master key, generate a pseudo-random block as large as one sector.
    
  You can use a block cipher with a large enough block size that it can encrypt the whole sector at once.
   
 ## Choose a password manager
 I chose Norton Password Manager, available here: [Norton PM](https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager).
   
 It is free and voted by Forbes as the overall best free password manager. Therefore it is accessible to many. It works on most platforms: Android, iOS, Mac and Windows.
 
 It operates locally in a browser extension. 
  
 ### What treaths does it protect against?
 It protects against head-on hacker attacks. The company also has a zero-knowledge policy, meaning only you have access to your vault.
 
 ### What information is encrypted, what's not?
 Norton utilizes 256-bit AES encryption on end-to-end level. It means everything inputted into the user's secure storage vault is encrypted. 
 
 ### What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
 The Norton Password manager legal license agreement can be read [here](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/legal/license-services-agreement/?ssdcat=175&env=prod&origin=idsafe&displang=iso3%3aENG&displocale=iso3%3aUSA&dest=lsa#password). It states that: 
   
*To use Password Manager, you will need to create a vault. The vault requires its own password. We do not store or keep your vault password so if you lose your vault password, we cannot recover it for you. It is your sole responsibility to remember and keep your vault password. You may then use your vault to store your logins, passwords and login URLâ€™s for other sites you access and use.*
  
I would describe this license as very short, but the whole NortonLifeLock page is very dense and legal. It is emphasized that the end-user carries the responsibility of the software working for them. 
 
 ### Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
 The data is stored in the cloud. According to NortonLifeLock support, "All data, including cloud storage, is held in the United States and the European Union".
 
 If there are any inquiries regarding the management of user's data, they provide regional privacy departments that can be found [here](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v127350378).
 
 ### How is the data protected?
 The data is protected by a robust encryption. Here is how the 256-bit AES encryption works:
   
 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a computer security standard for cryptographically securing electronic information. It is the only publicly available block cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for transmission and encryption of secret and top-secret information and intelligence.
 
It would take a supercomputer billions of years to crack even a 128-bit AES key. The 256-bit is the largest AES key length size and also the most difficult to crack.

AES 256-bit encryption uses 14 transformation rounds to convert plaintext into ciphertext. It is the most secure technically and some even call it overkill.
 
 ## Demonstrate the use of a password manager
 How to use Norton Password Manager:

 <img width="477" alt="norton2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221709205-84834911-1b28-4720-9a65-ed7bef2ec742.png">
  
 3. Approve of the pop-up warning.
 - Click "Add"
   
 <img width="219" alt="norton3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221709249-61cdfe2c-7b8b-464b-88e3-2f4ed9f9d7d9.png">
  
 4. Accept the installation.
 - Click "Accept"
    
 <img width="479" alt="norton4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221709291-6d65fc7c-53cf-4cf3-b9fa-0271dd4a2825.png">
  
 5. Set up your web browser.
 - Click "Next"
   
 <img width="473" alt="norton5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221709328-54bd3b03-aa9b-499c-8663-3921f612dced.png">
  
 6. Sign in if you already have an account, or sign up at the bottom right of the page
   
 <img width="473" alt="norton8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221709625-4fc7e89e-864a-4840-b2d7-73daca16eab9.png">
  
 7. Now the password manager is set up.
 
 Here is a demonstration of how it works in practice. After signing in the password manager can fill in your email and store a password for the website. Pictured below is an example of setting up an account on Babbel.
   
 <img width="478" alt="norton7" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221709651-4bb7226d-7a12-4e15-b497-1d06e3a776f0.png">
 
 I'm not installing Norton, because it actually doesn't look that good, and that's why my demonstration is lacking. However, I don't have time to rewrite my report. Instead, I will take this as an example that only reading one article isn't good research practice when deciding what software to install, and I will in the future research security software more deeply. 
  
 ## Encrypt and decrypt a message
 I'm using GnuPG for this task.
 
 First I installed GnuPG with this command:
 
    $ sudo apt install gnupg
    
 Then I created a file I wish to encrypt. I named it encryptthisfile.
   
 <img width="260" alt="encrypt1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221807277-c64db204-9fc5-44c2-b4f7-0f6bd270ef58.png">
  
 With the below command, I encrypt the file.
 
    $ gpg -c encryptthisfile.txt
    
 This command will open a pop-up window prompting the user for a passphrase. This passphrase is used as a password to decrypt the file. Only the user knows the passphrase, so forgetting it will result in the file being lost since decryption will not be possible.
   
 <img width="164" alt="encrypt2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221808578-064bc874-3469-4c21-8b87-3f3425d3d1b3.png">
  
With this a new encrypted copy of the file will be created, with the file tag .gpg. The original file can still be read with the cat command, so if that is not wanted the original file should be deleted. 

<img width="330" alt="encrypt3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221810176-132c646c-b917-4334-a35d-25279e79a45e.png">

Here we cannot read the encrypted file:
  
<img width="415" alt="encrypt4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221810485-3b0160ac-a38d-4464-a7f3-4c334d347138.png">
  
If we wish to read it, we need to decrypt it, with the below command, and the passphrase.
  
    $ gpg -d encryptthisfile.txt.gpg
    
<img width="266" alt="encrypt5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/221811315-ed6e8d70-fdca-4496-bc12-56eae3afe9d0.png">
  
For me, I wasn't asked for the passphrase. According to this [website](https://devconnected.com/how-to-encrypt-file-on-linux/), it's because "the GPG utility will create a set of keys for you in your home directory when you unlock a file (or create it)". I assume if I send this encrypted file for someone without access to the keys created to my directory, they will be prompted for the passphrase to decrypt the file.
 
There are multiple ways to encrypt files, zip is also a way.
