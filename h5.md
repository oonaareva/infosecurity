 ## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 
 
  ### 10.1, Choosing an algorithm
  When choosing an algorithm, one can trust one of these to be reliable:
  - a published algorithm that has not yet been broken
  - a well-known manufacturer
  - a private consultant
  - the government
  - write own algorithm

All of these have their problems, but the first one is the most sensible. It's difficult to choose the most secure algorithms, because the most secure ones are probably developed by the military, but we don't know what algorithms various military cryptanalysts are capable of breaking. A good assumption is that the NSA (National Security Agency of USA) can read any message that it chooses, but not all messages that it chooses, because they are also burdened by limited resources. They also prefer to keep their code-breaking skills a secret. The NSA approves all cryptographic products for export, and there is a conspiracy that they know how to break all export algorithms.
  
  ### 10.2, Public-key cryptography versus symmetric cryptography
  These two types of cryptography have been debated agaisnt each other since the invention of public-key cryptography, but they can't be compared on an equal footing. 
   
  Symmetric cryptography is best for encrypting data. Public-key cryptography is best for key management and a lot of protocols.
  
  ### 10.3, Encyrpting communications channels
  - OSI Open Systems Interconnect communications models
  *link-by-link encryption*: encryption that takes place at the lowest layers of the OSI model. Everything going through a particular data link is encrypted.
  - Hardware encryption devices at the physical layer is the easiest way to add encryption. It's also very effective, because everything is encrypted, such as data, routing and protocol information.
  - traffic-flow security: enemy doesn't have access to the information nor where and how much information is flowing.
  - The problem with physical layer encryption is that any unencrypted link will jeopardize the entire network's security. 
  - Also, every node (a what?) must be protected. If the network misroutes information, anyone can read it. 
    
    
  *end-to-end encryption*: encrytpion that takes place on the higher layers of the OSI model. Data stays encrypted until decryption by final recipient.
  
  ### 10.4
  
  
  
 ## Choose a password manager
  
 ### What treaths does it protect against?
 
 ### What information is encrypted, what's not?
 
 ### What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
 
 ### Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
 
 ### How is the data protected?
 
 
 
 ## Demonstrate the use of a password manager
 
 
 
 ## Encrypt and decrypt a message
