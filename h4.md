  ### Chapter 2.3 One-way functions
  
One-way functions act as building blocks to protocols. They are easy to compute, but harder to reverse. Harder meaning millions of years for multiple computers. One-way functions aren't good for encryption, because no one could decrypt them to read the message. 
   
A trapdoor one-way function is a special one-way function with a secret trapdoor. Basically a one-way function with the solve key.
   
 ### Chapter 2.4 One-way hash functions
 
One-way hash functions have many names, and are also central building blocks to protocols. A hash function takes a pre-image and turns it into a hash value. With a hash function we produce a value to check if a candidate pre-image is likely to match the real pre-image. A one-way hash function is hard to decrypt, because it is difficult to produce a pre-image that hashes to a particular value. Collision-free means it is difficult to produce two pre-images with the same hash value. The security of a hash function comes from its one-wayness.
   
A message authentication code (MAC) is a one-way hash function with a secret key. It's the same as hash functions, but only someone with the key can verify the hash value to be correct. Usually with one-way hash functions, anyone can verify the hash. 
  
 ## Install hashcat
  
I have installed Hashcat, and also the dictionary RockYou. It took a lot of time, because I also had to re-install Debian Virtual Box, which I kept messing up.

 ## Crack the hash.
  
The given hash is: 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f. 
  
For this exercise, I first identified the hashtype with command below:
  
    $ hashid -m 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f
  
From the output I could see the hashcat parameter to use for the MD5 hash type. So I search the dictionary using that:
  
    $ hashcat -m 0 '8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f' rockyou.txt
   
I didn't store it in a new file, because I don't need it after this exercise. I used the --show command to read the hash.
  
Proof:

 ## Compile John the Ripper.
  
For this exercise I followed the instructions on [terokarvinen.com](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/). I accidentally installed it on the previous hashed directory, so the pathway in the final step was:
  
    $ $HOME/hashed/john/run/john

 ## Crack a zip-file password.
   
 For this exercise I used the *tero.zip* available on [terokarvinen.com](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/). Again, I followed the instructions on the website, except my pathways were, for example:
 
    $ $HOME/hashed/john/run/john tero.zip.hash 
 
This is because my john the ripper compiler is in 'hashed' directory.
