  ### Chapter 2.3 One-way functions
  
One-way functions act as building blocks to protocols. They are easy to compute, but harder to reverse. Harder meaning millions of years for multiple computers. One-way functions aren't good for encryption, because no one could decrypt them to read the message. 
   
A trapdoor one-way function is a special one-way function with a secret trapdoor. Basically a one-way function with the solve key.
   
 ### Chapter 2.4 One-way hash functions
 
One-way hash functions have many names, and are also central building blocks to protocols. A hash function takes a pre-image and turns it into a hash value. With a hash function we produce a value to check if a candidate pre-image is likely to match the real pre-image. A one-way hash function is hard to decrypt, because it is difficult to produce a pre-image that hashes to a particular value. Collision-free means it is difficult to produce two pre-images with the same hash value. The security of a hash function comes from its one-wayness.
   
A message authentication code (MAC) is a one-way hash function with a secret key. It's the same as hash functions, but only someone with the key can verify the hash value to be correct. Usually with one-way hash functions, anyone can verify the hash.
