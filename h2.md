# Homework assignment 2

x) Read and summarize (This subtask x does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)
OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

  A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
  - applications can have unnecessary functions installed, there are pathways for adversaries to enter through due to security mishaps
  - data leaks can happen

  A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  - eqipment is outdated or broken, which can lead to misuse
  - always stay on track what equipment is being used, check where to download proper applications and stay updated on reported application malfunctions

  A03:2021-Injection
  - vulnerabilities occur when data is not separated from commands and queries
  - source code reviews are the best method to check for vulnerabilities
  - attacks compromise data integrity and can corrupt or delete data
  
  
#  Any episode from Darknet Diaries.
  
I chose episode 123: Newswires.

It's generally about how companies publish their yearly financial reports that affect their stock price. The hackers sought to get these reports in advance from the public, and then buy stocks from companies that did well and sell after the report publication, making big profits. Or shorting the stock instead. Trading based on insider information is illegal, the hackers had no right to gain an unfair advantage over knowing this reports contents prior to others. Companies have a legal responsibility to publish their reports to their investors, and many big one will use newswires to do that. Newswires are basically just press releases. There were three newspapers sites that published these reports, and had the reports sitting on their servers before they were scheduled to be released. The hackers found that these three sites were vulnerable for SQL injection. He attacked the sites for months until he got it to work, and then he just scooped up about 900 reports.
  
#  Pick a CVE, and briefly explain it & why it matters
  - CVE-2018-0121
  - Cisco Elastic Services Controller Service Portal Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Cisco web-based service portal could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass security authentication and use admin priviledges on affected systems.

The vulnerability is caused by improper security restrictions, so that the attacker could enter an empty pasword when prompted for admin password.

With admin priviledges, the attackers could cause real harm to Cisco web-portal users. 

  - SIDENOTE: there are CVEs as old as me apparently: CVE-1999-0819, NTMail does not disable the VRFY command, even if the administrator has explicitly disabled it.
