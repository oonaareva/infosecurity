OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

  A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
  - applications can have unnecessary functions installed, there are pathways for adversaries to enter through due to security mishaps
  - data leaks can happen

  A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  - eqipment is outdated or broken, which can lead to misuse
  - always stay on track what equipment is being used, check where to download proper applications and stay updated on reported application malfunctions

  A03:2021-Injection
  - vulnerabilities occur when data is not separated from commands and queries
  - source code reviews are the best method to check for vulnerabilities
  - attacks compromise data integrity and can corrupt or delete data
  
  
#  Any episode from Darknet Diaries.
  
I chose episode 123: Newswires.

It's generally about how companies publish their yearly financial reports that affect their stock price. The hackers sought to get these reports in advance from the public, and then buy stocks from companies that did well and sell after the report publication, making big profits. Or shorting the stock instead. Trading based on insider information is illegal, the hackers had no right to gain an unfair advantage over knowing this reports contents prior to others. Companies have a legal responsibility to publish their reports to their investors, and many big one will use newswires to do that. Newswires are basically just press releases. There were three newspapers sites that published these reports, and had the reports sitting on their servers before they were scheduled to be released. The hackers found that these three sites were vulnerable for SQL injection. He attacked the sites for months until he got it to work, and then he just scooped up about 900 reports.

The scheme had to be carried out really fast, each time. Sometimes there was just 30 minutes time to download the reports before the markets closed. Then they would buy millions of stock 4 minutes before the markets closed, and when the stocks value rose midnight, they would sell the stocks in the morning, making millions in profit under 24 hours.

The SEC, The US Securities and Exchange Commission, have an algorithm that tracks all trading and looks for patterns of insider trading and other illegal methods. It's name is ARTEMIS. After a while this scheme had been in progress, the SEC took note of one of their accounts, and took it under surveillance. After the hacker logged into this account, the SEC got his IP address, which they also found out had logged into the press release sites to download reports. 

The hacker Ivan had been out drinking with friends, and bragged about a scam he was pulling. His friends wanted in on it, and when he said no, his friends also hacked the newswire and cut Ivan's access to the site off. The newswire didn't know that they had competing hackers breaking into their servers. It was the FBI that notified them that their servers had been breached, and so they began investigating who had done it. Then the Ukrainian Intelligence Agency raided homes to find Ivan and his friends. Similarly in the US, the traders were arrested in their homes, without really having catched on that the FBI had been watching them and caught their scheme. Authorities say there were in total 32 people involved with this scheme. The main people received prison sentences and had to pay million of dollars in forfeiture.
  
#  Pick a CVE, and briefly explain it & why it matters
  - CVE-2018-0121
  - Cisco Elastic Services Controller Service Portal Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Cisco web-based service portal could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass security authentication and use admin priviledges on affected systems.

The vulnerability is caused by improper security restrictions, so that the attacker could enter an empty pasword when prompted for admin password.

With admin priviledges, the attackers could cause real harm to Cisco web-portal users. 

  - SIDENOTE: there are CVEs as old as me apparently: CVE-1999-0819, NTMail does not disable the VRFY command, even if the administrator has explicitly disabled it.
