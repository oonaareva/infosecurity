  Any episode from Darknet Diaries.
    I chose episode 123: Newswires.
    It's generally about how companies publish their yearly financial reports that affect their stock price. The hackers sought to get these reports in advance from the public, and then buy stocks from companies that did well and sell after the report publication, making big profits. Or shorting the stock instead. Trading based on insider information is illegal, the hackers had no right to gain an unfair advantage over knowing this reports contents prior to others. Companies have a legal responsibility to publish their reports to their investors, and many big one will use newswires to do that. Newswires are basically just press releases. There were three newspapers sites that published these reports, and had the reports sitting on their servers before they were scheduled to be released. The hackers found that these three sites were vulnerable for SQL injection. He attacked the sites for months until he got it to work, and then he just scooped up about 900 reports.

  2 SELECT from World, from first subtask to 5 "France, Germany, Italy"
  - I think for this one only going through the tutorial was necessary, so that is what i did.

b) Injected. Solve WebGoat:
