# Homework Assignment 3 

x) Read and summarize 
Costa-Gazc√≥n 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary

- The chapter 4 focuses on how to use the Mitre Attack framework to map intelligence reports.
- The Att&ack framework is a descriptive model of how adversaries intrude on systems, and it provides a common taxonomy so that understanding and communication between offensive, defensive and non-specialists can work.
- The Att&ck enterprise tactics are:
  - Reconnaissance
  - Resource Development
  - Initial access
  - Execution
  - Persistence
  - Privilege escalation
  - Defense evasion
  - Credential access
  - Discovery
  - Lateral movement
  - Collection
  - Command and control
  - Exfiltration
  - Impact
- Each of these tactics is composed of a set of techniques that describe specific threat actor behaviors.
- The procedure is the specific way in which a threat actor implements a specific technique or sub-technique.
- The Att&ck matrix is structured as tactics, techniques and sub-techniques
- The Att&ck navigator is an instrument for visualising a modus operandi, tool behaviour or used as a security exercise. In it you add techniques to layers and score them.

Mapping with Att&ck (summary of the methods used)

- FormBook is an infostealer, with it's code written in ASM C. 
1. Based on Gabriela Nicolao's paper on Formbook, let's compile a list of specific behaviours.
2. Let's try to assign the behaviours to the Att&ck tactics.
3. Once you've identified the tactic, see which technique best describes the behaviours.
4. List all possible sub-techniques of the techniques identified.

y) Write an answer with references.  Answer in the context of Mitre Att&ck, and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x.

**Define tactic and give an example.**
Tactics are the adversaries tactical objective, the reason they are performing an action. They cover what the adversaries do during their attack. In the Att&ck matrix, tactics are treated as tags, and techniques/subtechniques can be tagged with several tactics, depending on the different results that are achieved with it.

All tactics contain a description and guide for what techniques should be listed under it.

Example: 

**Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each.**
Techniques represent how the adversary achieves their tactical objective. They can also represent what the adversaries gain by their taken action. For example, what type of information the adversaries are after.

Example:

Sub-techniques are more specific descriptions of how behaviour is used to achieve an objective. I guess specific technical ways to perform an attack.

Example:

**Define procedure, and give an example.**
Procedures are the specific implementations adversaries have used for the technique/sub-technique. They are how an adversary uses the technique/sub-technique. They can span multiple techniques/sub-techniques.

Example:

a) Webgoat: A3 Sensitive data exposure
