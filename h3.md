# Homework Assignment 3 

 ## x) Read and summarize 
*Costa-Gazc√≥n 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary*

- The chapter 4 focuses on how to use the Mitre Attack framework to map intelligence reports.
- The Att&ack framework is a descriptive model of how adversaries intrude on systems, and it provides a common taxonomy so that understanding and communication between offensive, defensive and non-specialists can work.
- The Att&ck enterprise tactics are:
  - Reconnaissance
  - Resource Development
  - Initial access
  - Execution
  - Persistence
  - Privilege escalation
  - Defense evasion
  - Credential access
  - Discovery
  - Lateral movement
  - Collection
  - Command and control
  - Exfiltration
  - Impact
- Each of these tactics is composed of a set of techniques that describe specific threat actor behaviors.
- The procedure is the specific way in which a threat actor implements a specific technique or sub-technique.
- The Att&ck matrix is structured as tactics, techniques and sub-techniques
- The Att&ck navigator is an instrument for visualising a modus operandi, tool behaviour or used as a security exercise. In it you add techniques to layers and score them.
*Mapping with Att&ck (summary of the methods used)*
- FormBook is an infostealer, with it's code written in ASM C. 
1. Based on Gabriela Nicolao's paper on Formbook, let's compile a list of specific behaviours.
2. Let's try to assign the behaviours to the Att&ck tactics.
3. Once you've identified the tactic, see which technique best describes the behaviours.
4. List all possible sub-techniques of the techniques identified.

 ## y) Write an answer with references.  Answer in the context of Mitre Att&ck, and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x.

**Define tactic and give an example.**
Tactics are the adversaries tactical objective, the reason they are performing an action. They cover what the adversaries do during their attack. In the Att&ck matrix, tactics are treated as tags, and techniques/subtechniques can be tagged with several tactics, depending on the different results that are achieved with it.

All tactics contain a description and guide for what techniques should be listed under it.

Example: Impact (ID TA0040)
Adversary's goal is to manipulate, interrupt or destroy systems or data. The methods disrupt availability and compromisy integrity. Business processes may look fine on the outside. This technique may be used to provide cover for the confidentiality breach.

**Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each.**
Techniques represent how the adversary achieves their tactical objective. They can also represent what the adversaries gain by their taken action. For example, what type of information the adversaries are after.

Example: Defacement (ID T1491)
Adversaries can modify visual content internally or externally and thus compromising integrity of content. Reasons for this can be messaging, intimidation or claiming credit for intrusion. Defacement can be used to cause discomfort or complience through disturbing images, for example. Mitigation plan is to have a back-ups that are stored off system.

Sub-techniques are more specific descriptions of how behaviour is used to achieve an objective. I guess specific technical ways to perform an attack.

Example: Internal Defacement (ID T1491.001)
With this adversaries may make modifications to internal websites or directly to the device, for example changing desktop wallpaper. Usually takes place after the intrusion goals have been achieved, since this method exposes the intrusion.

**Define procedure, and give an example.**
Procedures are the specific implementations adversaries have used for the technique/sub-technique. They are how an adversary uses the technique/sub-technique. They can span multiple techniques/sub-techniques.

Example: Gamaredon Group (ID G0047)
Gamaredon Group left taunting images on victims' desktops as proof of intrusion and system access. Gamaredon Group are Russian cyber espionage threat group, that have targeted multiple Ukrainian organizations (military also) since 2013.

 ## a) Webgoat: A3 Sensitive data exposure
Insecure Login: 2 Let's try

The task is to log in by intercepting a request of another user's login credentials.

The answer is to click the "Open Application menu" button on the web browser (at least in Mozilla Firefox). Then select "more tools" at the bottom of the menu. From here, choose "Web Developer Tools".

With this, a window should pop-up at the bottom of the page, with a "Network" tab. Choose it. Now click the "log in" button in the webgoat exercise. You should see a "start.mvc" file show up. Click on it, and then find a "Request" tab on the new pop-up menu window. The username and password are there. Write them without the "" marks and then press submit.
