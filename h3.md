# Homework Assignment 3 

x) Read and summarize 
Costa-Gazc√≥n 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary

- The chapter 4 focuses on how to use the Mitre Attack framework to map intelligence reports.
- The Att&ack framework is a descriptive model of how adversaries intrude on systems, and it provides a common taxonomy so that understanding and communication between offensive, defensive and non-specialists can work.
- The Att&ck enterprise tactics are:
  - Reconnaissance
  - Resource Development
  - Initial access
  - Execution
  - Persistence
  - Privilege escalation
  - Defense evasion
  - Credential access
  - Discovery
  - Lateral movement
  - Collection
  - Command and control
  - Exfiltration
  - Impact
- Each of these tactics is composed of a set of techniques that describe specific threat actor behaviors.
- The procedure is the specific way in which a threat actor implements a specific technique or sub-technique.
- The Att&ck matrix is structured as tactics, techniques and sub-techniques
- The Att&ck navigator is an instrument for visualising a modus operandi, tool behaviour or used as a security exercise. In it you add techniques to layers and score them.

Mapping with Att&ck (summary of the methods used)

- FormBook is an infostealer, with it's code written in ASM C. 
1. Based on Gabriela Nicolao's paper on Formbook, let's compile a list of specific behaviours.
2. Let's try to assign the behaviours to the Att&ck tactics.
3. Once you've identified the tactic, see which technique best describes the behaviours.
4. List all possible sub-techniques of the techniques identified.

y) Write an answer with references (this subtask does not require tests with a computer). Answer in the context of Mitre Att&ck, and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x.
Define tactic and give an example.
Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each.
Define procedure, and give an example of each.
