# H1 homework assignments

x) Read and summarize. 

  Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action
  - abstract: advanced persistent threats can defeat most conventional computer defense mechanisms
  - institutionalizing a kill chain model can be used to combat these adversary attacks

  - 3.2: the computer intrusion kill chain is modeled after U.S. military defense model
  - the 7 phases are:
  - reconnaissance: researching specific data, like mailing addresses
  - weaponization: delivering a trojan in the form of a pdf document for example
  - delivery: transmission of the deliverable to the victim environment, most common ways are email attachments, websites, usbs
  - exploitation: after the weapon is delivered to victim, it triggers attackers code. most typically attacks an application or operating system vulnerability
  - installation: attackers maintain their persistence on the target, through remote acess or a backdoor
  - command and control: intruders can have hands-on access to target computers
  - actions on objectives: after success on the first 6 steps, the attackers can now work on their objectives, such as data exfiltration

  - 3.3: 
  - defense mechanisms can be measured by their effectiveness and investment roadmaps can be made
  - matrix illustrates defender capabilities agaisnt IO doctrine
  - resiliency and and indicator utilization helps defenders against repetitive or persistent attacks
  - resiliency can be achieved by relevant detection and mitigation, but also learning from attacks and placing new indicators for the future

a) Bandit oh-five. Solve Over The Wire: Bandit the first five levels (0-4).
Level 0: logging into the game
- here i had to download openssh client and then connect to the remote server. this website was really helpful: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ssh-to-connect-to-remote-server-linux-or-windows .

<img width="414" alt="bandit level0 clear" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214925943-bd41b0d1-d835-4711-87f5-011723a1a101.png">

Level 0 -> 1: finding the password
- here i had to read the password from file readme. With command ls i found the file and with command cat i read the contents of the file.

<img width="432" alt="bandit level1 clear" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214930688-b4281ece-d9f6-4a7d-9a8b-3a36df6d76a8.png">

Level 1 -> 2: dashed filename
- here the problem is that the filename starts with a dash, so it requires cat < command to open it, with just the cat command it opens a text-editor like screen? to exit it in the future, press ctrl +c. this is the website i used for help: https://www.webservertalk.com/dashed-filename .
<img width="436" alt="bandit level2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214932820-c7b10bb8-9353-42e0-aec3-0682f7bb58be.png">
<img width="433" alt="bandit level2 clear" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214933302-dff09053-9725-4157-b433-802fa762a15f.png">

Level 2 -> 3: spaces
- to read a file with spaces in the name, use single quotes around the filename. there is also a way to place a backwards slash before the filename, but i will use single quotes in the future for simplicity. here is the website i used to solve this level: https://linuxhint.com/reference-filename-with-spaces-linux/ .
- also, here zero has the dot in the middle and letter o is without.
<img width="433" alt="bandit level3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214934374-d0171ab2-ca52-4c83-975d-96d38c8a1144.png">
<img width="435" alt="bandit level3 clear" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214935702-94f4751e-ce5f-4f1a-8d06-3608b0c1ae0e.png">

Level 3 -> 4: hidden files
- first we need to get to the right directory, we use command cd "name". listing the files in that directory with command ls doesn't show anything, so we need to use ls -a, which shows all files, even hidden ones. then with regular cat .hidden we can read the file.

<img width="433" alt="bandit level4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214937091-c878963e-af40-4916-9b84-78ed1ca74fb3.png">

<img width="436" alt="bandit level4 clear" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214937491-6ceee117-4084-4cd3-aefd-4fcec18317a5.png">

b) Bullseye. Install Debian 11-Bullseye virtual machine in VirtualBox. (See also: Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox)
  - for this exercise i have followed the above website for instructions on how to install Debian on Oracle VM.
<img width="414" alt="debian proof" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122969251/214908842-190d0f32-6510-46ec-a541-77fe42feed8d.png">
  - here is when i checked that copy-pasting a website link between host and VM works, after applying the Guest Additions:

c) WebGoat. Install WebGoat practice target. (See also: Karvinen 2021: Install Webgoat 8 - Learn Web Pentesting)
  - have installed it according to instructions, below should be proof of it.

  - and here i logged in:

d) Hacker warmup. Solve these tasks on WebGoat
  General: HTTP Basics
  General: Developer tools
  - haven't managed these yet.
