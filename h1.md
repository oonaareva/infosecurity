# H1 homework assignments
(if someone is reading this, i will format this later)

x) Read and summarize. (This subtask x does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary)

  Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action
  - abstract: advanced persistent threats can defeat most conventional computer defense mechanisms
  - institutionalizing a kill chain model can be used to combat these adversary attacks

  - 3.2: the computer intrusion kill chain is modeled after U.S. military defense model
  - the 7 phases are:
  - reconnaissance: researching specific data, like mailing addresses
  - weaponization: delivering a trojan in the form of a pdf document for example
  - delivery: transmission of the deliverable to the victim environment, most common ways are email attachments, websites, usbs
  - exploitation: after the weapon is delivered to victim, it triggers attackers code. most typically attacks an application or operating system vulnerability
  - installation: attackers maintain their persistence on the target, through remote acess or a backdoor
  - command and control: intruders can have hands-on access to target computers
  - actions on objectives: after success on the first 6 steps, the attackers can now work on their objectives, such as data exfiltration

  - 3.3: 
  - defense mechanisms can be measured by their effectiveness and investment roadmaps can be made
  - matrix illustrates defender capabilities agaisnt IO doctrine
  - resiliency and and indicator utilization helps defenders against repetitive or persistent attacks
  - resiliency can be achieved by relevant detection and mitigation, but also learning from attacks and placing new indicators for the future
